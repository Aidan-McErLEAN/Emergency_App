# I.C.E - In Case Emergency


This was an Ulster University Magee group project for (Mobile Development). In this project, came together to plan and assign andriod pages. You can see the andriod pages, which I created:

• Emergency Services 

• Emergency Contacts 

• Weather Status 

• Settings

The setting and emergency contact pages were originally assigned to another team member, however this team member was having trouble with their tasks. Myself, and the rest of the team, sent information and videos to our teammate, to help with the completion of their tasks, however the teammate informed the rest of the group, one day before the deadline, “Hi, everyone, I’m sorry, but I cannot do this module. I’m having a breakdown trying to complete the pages… but I just can’t do it”. Hearing this unfortunate information, I decided to complete teammate tasks myself which teammate was thankful and in agreement with this decision.

I am informing, this information because the code I wrote for the two pages is not professionally written, due to the lack of time and knowledge of firebase real-time database.
